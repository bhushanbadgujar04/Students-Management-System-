📌 Student Management System - Java (Console-Based)
Version: 1.0
Author: Bhushan Badgujar 
Date: 05/03/2025

1️⃣ Introduction
The Student Management System is a Java-based console application designed to store and manage student records efficiently. It allows users to add, update, remove, search, and display students. The data is stored persistently using file handling (Serialization).

This project is a great example of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Collections (HashMap, ArrayList), Exception Handling, and File Handling in Java.

2️⃣ Features
✔ Add a Student (ID, Name, Age, Grade)
✔ Remove a Student (By ID)
✔ Update Student Details
✔ Search for a Student (By ID)
✔ Display All Students
✔ Persistent Data Storage (File Handling - Serialization)

3️⃣ Technologies Used
Java (JDK 8+)
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Collections (HashMap, ArrayList)
Exception Handling
File Handling (Serialization)
Scanner (User Input Handling)

4️⃣ Project Structure
bash
Copy
Edit
StudentManagement/
│── Student.java           # Model class (Student entity)
│── StudentManager.java    # Business logic (CRUD operations, File handling)
│── Main.java              # Main program (User interaction)
│── students.dat           # Serialized student data file

5️⃣ Installation & Setup
🔹 Prerequisites
Install JDK (Java Development Kit)
Install a Java IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ, VS Code) or use the command line.

6️⃣ How to Use
Start the program → Select an option from the menu.
Add Student → Enter ID, Name, Age, and Grade.
Remove Student → Enter the Student ID to remove.
Update Student → Modify existing student details.
Search Student → Enter Student ID to find the student.
Display All Students → View all stored records.
Exit → The program automatically saves data.

7️⃣ Code Explanation
🔹 1. Student.java (Model Class)
Defines the Student class with attributes: ID, Name, Age, Grade.
Implements Serializable for file storage.
Provides Getters & Setters for data access.
🔹 2. StudentManager.java (Business Logic)
Uses HashMap<Integer, Student> to store student records.
Implements CRUD functions:
addStudent()
removeStudent()
updateStudent()
searchStudent()
displayAllStudents()
Uses Serialization & Deserialization for data persistence.
🔹 3. Main.java (User Interface)
Provides a menu-driven system for user input.
Uses Scanner to take user input.
Calls StudentManager functions based on user choices.

8️⃣ Future Enhancements
🔹 Add GUI (JavaFX or Swing for better user experience)
🔹 Database Integration (JDBC with MySQL instead of file storage)
🔹 Export Data to CSV (Generate reports)
🔹 Search by Name & Filters

📌 Conclusion
This Student Management System is a simple yet powerful Java-based project showcasing OOP, Collections, Exception Handling, and File Handling. It is an excellent project for learning Java fundamentals and can be expanded with advanced features. 🚀

Would you like me to extend this with JDBC or a GUI version? Let me know! 😊
